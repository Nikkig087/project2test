## Design Choices

### `Colour Scheme`

In designing the Quiz game website, a carefully curated colour palette was chosen to complement the site's aesthetic and functionality, featuring `#091f34` (deep navy blue), `#FFA500` (vibrant orange), and `#fff` (white) as primary elements. Additionally, specific colours are employed to visually signify correctness and incorrectness within the game interface: `#10862b` (green) for correct answers and `#8d111e` (red) for incorrect ones.

* `#091f34` provides a sophisticated, deep blue backdrop, enhancing the visual depth and setting a professional tone for the site.
* `#FFA500` is used to draw attention and guide user interaction, injecting vibrancy and energy into the quiz experience.
* `#fff` ensures text is clear and readable against the website's darker backgrounds.
* `#10862b` (green) visually communicates correct answers, reinforcing positive feedback and achievement.
* `#8d111e` (red) highlights incorrect choices, serving as an intuitive cue for users to learn and adapt their knowledge.

This combination of colours not only creates a visually appealing interface but also incorporates colour-coded feedback mechanisms (`#10862b` for correct answers and `#8d111e` for incorrect ones) to enhance the interactive learning experience. The result is a harmonious, engaging atmosphere that supports the quiz's educational goals while ensuring a delightful user experience.

The primary and accent colours utilized across the site for textual and interactive elements are `#091f34`, `#FFA500`, and `#fff`, with `#10862b` and `#8d111e` specifically used within the quiz for feedback on user responses.

![Colour Scheme](documentation/colour-scheme/colour-palettes.PNG)

### `Typography`

For the typography of the Quiz game website, Google Fonts was leveraged to import and integrate a font that complements the playful and engaging theme of the site.

* `Primary Font`: Comic Neue - Chosen for its modern reinterpretation of the traditional comic book font, Comic Neue adds a fun and legible touch to the user interface. Its design strikes a balance between playfulness and readability, making it an ideal choice for the cartoon trivia theme of my game. This font embodies the essence of the animated world, enhancing the overall user experience with its approachable and appealing appearance.

The use of Comic Neue throughout the site not only reinforces the thematic elements of the game but also ensures that text is easy to read and interact with, thereby improving usability and accessibility for players of all ages.

### `Imagery`

The imagery used in the Quiz game website plays a pivotal role in creating an immersive and visually appealing experience that captivates users and enhances the thematic focus on cartoons and animation. Each visual element has been carefully selected and integrated to complement the game's design and user interface, providing a rich and engaging atmosphere that resonates with fans of animated content.

* `Background Images`: The background of the website features high-resolution images inspired by popular animations, such as "Kung Fu Panda." These images set a vibrant and dynamic tone for the game, inviting users into the whimsical world of cartoons. The backgrounds are sourced from [Wall AlphaCoders](https://wall.alphacoders.com/big.php?i=690190), ensuring that they are of high quality and contribute positively to the aesthetic appeal of the site.

* `Iconography and Logo`: The website's logo and icons are designed to echo the playful and animated theme of the quiz. The logo (sourced from [Wallpaperaccess](https://wallpaperaccess.com/3d-cartoon#google_vignette)), featuring a stylized representation of cartoon elements, serves as a visual anchor for the site, reinforcing the game's identity and purpose. The icons used throughout the site, are chosen for their clear visual communication, thematic consistency and sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) . 

### `Wireframes`

Toons Quiz Game's development process began with the creation of detailed wireframes using Balsamiq wireframes. These wireframes served as blueprints for the game's design, ensuring a user-friendly interface and a seamless experience across various screens.

| 10 | `Background Music Playback` | My website features an immersive background music option, aimed at enhancing user experience by providing an engaging auditory atmosphere. Users have the control to enable or disable this feature according to their preference within the settings. Notably, when navigating through the website with the music enabled, there might be a brief delay in playback continuity or occasional pauses. This behavior primarily depends on the network's performance and the inherent challenge of maintaining seamless audio playback across multiple pages. | To address this, a unified HTML structure for the entire website could potentially streamline the audio experience. However, in prioritizing ease of maintenance, scalability, and efficient debugging processes, I've opted to maintain separate HTML files for each page. This decision, while momentarily affecting the audio playback's fluidity, significantly simplifies code management and facilitates quicker issue resolution, ensuring a more stable and reliable website for my users. I am continually exploring innovative solutions to enhance this feature without compromising on the core development principles.
